# Class: Programming Languages 220
# Date: 9/23/2015
# Program Name: Battleship Game Python
# Programmers: Bjorn Mathisen and Jacob Huss
# Description of Program: A battleship clone game, the end goal is for either the player or the AI/computer
#                         to destroy all the ships on the opposing team. They can accomplish this with a 
#                         varriety of artillary, including bombs, torpedoes, and single hit missiles. The 
#                         AI is programmed to select random coordinates and on occasion use a limited supply
#                         of artillary, the same amount is alloted to the player. For deployment purposes
#                         the player can select either manual or automatic deployment, the computers ships
#                         are always randomly automatically assigned positions. When the player places his
#                         ships he has the option to place them left, right, up or down. Error checking 
#                         validates these coordinates before placing a ship. To view the players/enemy board
#                         a algorithm was designed that would allow the programming to view the map as values
#                         and the player would see appropriate symbols depending on the ship, and the damage
#                         that each ship has sustained. A table depicting all possible values and their meaning
#                         has been constructed below, as well as a table of all the possible ships plus any 
#                         other information that might be requried either by the programmer or the player 
#                         should he so desire to see it.
